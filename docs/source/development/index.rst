**CPU-Only Testing**: OpenHCS supports CPU-only mode for CI environments without GPU dependencies. See :doc:`../user_guide/cpu_only_mode` for configuration details.

**CI Configuration Example**:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # .github/workflows/tests.yml
   name: Tests
   on: [push, pull_request]

   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Set up Python
           uses: actions/setup-python@v3
           with:
             python-version: '3.9'
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: |
             pip install -e .
             pip install pytest
         - name: Run tests in CPU-only mode
           env:
             OPENHCS_CPU_ONLY: 1
           run: pytest tests/

**Key Benefits**:
- No GPU dependencies required for CI
- Faster test execution in cloud environments
- Consistent test results across different hardware
- Full pipeline logic validation without GPU acceleration
