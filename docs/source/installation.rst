Installation
============

The canonical installation instructions live in the Getting Started guide.

See :doc:`getting_started/getting_started` for full installation options (1-minute quick start, CPU/GPU options, and development install).

If you have a CI or headless environment, prefer the "CPU-Only Installation" section in the Getting Started guide.
