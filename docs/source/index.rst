Welcome to OpenHCS Documentation
=================================

OpenHCS is a bioimage analysis platform for high-content screening datasets. It provides unified access to Python image processing libraries with automatic GPU acceleration and memory management for large-scale microscopy data analysis.

For Biologists
--------
Want to get started with using OpenHCS without dealing with technical details? Check out :doc:`guide_for_biologists/index`.

Overview
--------

OpenHCS addresses the computational challenges of high-content screening by providing:

- **Unified interface** to major Python image processing libraries (scikit-image, CuCIM, pyclesperanto)
- **Automatic GPU acceleration** with seamless memory type conversion
- **Scalable processing** for datasets ranging from single images to 100GB+ experiments
- **Microscope format compatibility** supporting multiple vendor platforms

Quick Start
-----------

.. code-block:: bash

    # Install OpenHCS with desktop GUI
    pip install "openhcs[gui]"
    openhcs-gui

    # Or install with terminal interface (for remote/SSH use)
    pip install "openhcs[tui]"
    openhcs-tui

For complete installation and basic examples, see :doc:`getting_started/getting_started`.

Core Capabilities
-----------------

**Library Integration**
